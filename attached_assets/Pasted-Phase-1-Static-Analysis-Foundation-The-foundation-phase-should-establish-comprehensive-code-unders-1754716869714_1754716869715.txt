Phase 1: Static Analysis Foundation
The foundation phase should establish comprehensive code understanding through mature static analysis techniques. This phase provides the deterministic accuracy and scalability required for enterprise-grade analysis.

Core Components:

Parser and AST Generation: Build a robust COBOL parser that handles multiple dialects and compiler variations

Dependency Analysis: Create comprehensive mappings of program relationships, data flows, and external interfaces

Quality Metrics: Generate standard metrics for complexity, maintainability, and technical debt

Vulnerability Detection: Implement security scanning capabilities tailored to COBOL-specific risks

Success Criteria:

95% code coverage across all supported COBOL dialects

Complete dependency mapping with sub-second query response times

Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines and development workflows

Phase 2: AI Enhancement Layer
The second phase integrates fine-tuned LLMs to provide semantic understanding and natural language capabilities, building upon the solid foundation of static analysis.

Key Capabilities:

Code Explanation: Generate natural language explanations of COBOL programs and functions

Documentation Generation: Create comprehensive documentation from code analysis

Pattern Recognition: Identify business logic patterns and architectural elements

Developer Assistance: Provide contextual help and guidance for COBOL developers

Implementation Strategy:

Deploy specialized COBOL models like XMainframe or develop custom fine-tuned models

Implement robust validation mechanisms to detect and prevent hallucinations

Create feedback loops to continuously improve model accuracy based on user validation

Phase 3: Business Rules Extraction Specialization
The third phase incorporates sophisticated business rules extraction capabilities to capture institutional knowledge and support modernization initiatives.

Specialized Functions:

Rule Identification: Automatically identify potential business rules based on code patterns and data flows

Expert Validation: Provide tools for subject matter experts to validate and refine extracted rules

Process Mapping: Generate business process flows showing how rules interact within the system

Compliance Support: Document regulatory requirements and compliance-related logic

Integration Approach:

Build upon static analysis results to identify candidate business rules

Use AI models to generate initial rule descriptions for expert validation

Create collaborative workflows that enable business and technical stakeholders to work together

Phase 4: Unified Integration Platform
The final phase creates a unified platform that integrates all analysis methods and provides comprehensive insights through intuitive interfaces.

Platform Features:

Unified Dashboard: Provide single-pane-of-glass visibility across all analysis dimensions

Cross-Method Validation: Use multiple analysis methods to validate findings and increase confidence

Modernization Planning: Generate comprehensive modernization roadmaps based on integrated analysis

Risk Assessment: Provide holistic risk analysis considering technical, business, and operational factors

Architecture Principles:

API-first design enabling integration with existing tools and workflows

Modular architecture supporting different deployment models and use cases

Enterprise-grade security and compliance capabilities

Scalable infrastructure supporting analysis of massive codebases
