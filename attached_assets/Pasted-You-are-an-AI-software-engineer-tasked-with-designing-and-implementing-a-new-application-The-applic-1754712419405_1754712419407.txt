You are an AI software engineer tasked with designing and implementing a new application.
The application should include the following functionalities:

From GitHub COBOL Documentation Generator:

Upload COBOL applications to GitHub for automatic processing.

Break COBOL code into sections for structured documentation.

Automatically update documentation when the code changes.

Generate documentation for:

Initialized files with Mermaid diagrams.

Book file with extensive explanation.

Member file with brief explanation plus a complete decision tree that repeats throughout documentation.

Provide visual diagrams for every documentation session.

From Tribal by Hyper Cubic:
6. Connect to a codebase via repository link (e.g., GitHub).
7. Automatically fetch and parse the codebase.
8. Perform deep code comprehension to identify:

Business logic.

Interdependencies between files.

Function-level details and behaviors.

Naming conventions common in COBOL.

Generate an AI-powered documentation hub including:

Overview & high-level docs (summary, goals/non-goals, background, architecture, error handling).

Automatic high-level architecture diagrams showing service interactions.

Architecture design diagrams for key flows (e.g., request handling sequences).

Getting started guide (setup, onboarding, tech stack, glossary).

High-level documentation per service (overview, goals, design, data flows).

Business logic breakdown (source, purpose, responsibilities, use cases, inputs, outputs, dependencies).

Dependency mapping (libraries, APIs, services like IBM Z/OS).

Your task:

Design a full system architecture that integrates all of these functionalities into one cohesive application.

Define modules, APIs, data models, and AI capabilities required.

Describe the workflow from code ingestion to final documentation output and continuous updates.

Include UI/UX design suggestions, automation triggers, and security considerations.

Provide the complete technical specification so a development team can build the application.
