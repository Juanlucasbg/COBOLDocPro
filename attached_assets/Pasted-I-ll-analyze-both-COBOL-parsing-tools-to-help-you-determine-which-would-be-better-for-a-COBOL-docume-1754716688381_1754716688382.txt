I'll analyze both COBOL parsing tools to help you determine which would be better for a COBOL documenting tool. Let me search for information about these parsers and their characteristics.Based on my analysis of both COBOL parsers, here's a comprehensive comparison to help you decide which is better for a COBOL documenting tool:

## **Koopa COBOL Parser**

### Strengths:
- Custom DSL approach using island grammars (.kg files) that makes the grammar easily extensible with minimal impact on overall code
- Can handle source files in isolation without preprocessing and accepts CICS/SQL fragments natively
- Built-in GUI with visualization capabilities including syntax highlighting, parse tree visualization, and XPath query support
- Excellent for documentation - includes XML export and custom XPath queries for analysis
- BSD license (more permissive)
- Proven track record - used by Tocea for COBOL auditing software
- Interactive features for documentation like navigating from source to grammar rules

### Weaknesses:
- Older architecture (not ANTLR4-based)
- Build system uses ANT rather than Maven
- Less structured semantic analysis compared to ProLeap's ASG

## **ProLeap COBOL Parser**

### Strengths:
- Modern ANTLR4-based architecture with both AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and ASG (Abstract Semantic Graph) generation
- ASG provides rich semantic analysis with data and control flow information, variable access tracking
- Comprehensive preprocessor handling COPY, REPLACE, CBL, and PROCESS statements
- Rigorous test-driven development and passes NIST test suite
- Successfully applied to numerous COBOL files from banking and insurance sectors
- Maven-based build system with easy dependency management
- Handles multiple source formats (fixed, variable, tandem)
- Active development with regular updates and bug fixes
- Better programmatic API for integration

### Weaknesses:
- Requires preprocessing step (though comprehensive)
- More complex setup for simple parsing tasks
- Less built-in visualization tools compared to Koopa

## **Recommendation for Documentation Tool**

**For a COBOL documenting tool, I recommend using ProLeap COBOL Parser**, with the following reasoning:

1. **Richer Semantic Information**: ProLeap's ASG provides much deeper program understanding crucial for documentation - it tracks variable usage, data flow, and control flow which are essential for comprehensive documentation.

2. **Better Programmatic Integration**: ProLeap's modern Java API and Maven integration make it easier to build custom documentation tools on top of it.

3. **Production-Proven**: Its successful use in banking and insurance sectors demonstrates reliability with real-world COBOL code.

4. **Active Maintenance**: More recent updates and active development ensure better support for modern COBOL variants.

## **Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)**

You could actually use **both parsers** for different aspects of your documentation tool:

1. **Use ProLeap as the primary parser** for:
   - Core parsing and semantic analysis
   - Extracting program structure and relationships
   - Variable usage and data flow documentation
   - Generating comprehensive program documentation

2. **Use Koopa for complementary features**:
   - Quick visualization and exploration during development
   - XPath-based queries for specific documentation needs
   - Interactive grammar exploration features
   - Handling edge cases where its island grammar approach excels

## **Implementation Strategy**

```java
// Example: Using ProLeap for documentation generation
CobolParserParams params = new CobolParserParamsImpl();
params.setCopyBookDirectories(Arrays.asList("copybooks/"));
Program program = new CobolParserRunnerImpl()
    .analyzeFile(inputFile, CobolSourceFormatEnum.FIXED, params);

// Access rich semantic information for documentation
CompilationUnit cu = program.getCompilationUnit("MYPROG");
DataDivision dataDivision = cu.getProgramUnit().getDataDivision();
// Generate documentation from ASG...
```

The ProLeap parser's semantic graph makes it particularly well-suited for generating detailed documentation including data dictionaries, call graphs, variable cross-references, and impact analysis - all critical components of a comprehensive COBOL documentation tool.
